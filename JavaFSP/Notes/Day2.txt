In java when an object looses its reference that object is considered in no longer in use. Such kinds of un-refernce objects are called garbage in java.
JVM keeps track of such kind of un-reference objects and remove them from memory automatically when required. This mechanism of automatic removal of un-
-reference objects by JVM is called garbage collection. The time for garbage collection can not be predicted in advance.

Short Note:- A particular object can have more than one references but a single reference variable cannot point to 2 objects at the same time.

Inheritance
It is the mechanism by which one class aquires the features of another class. Through inheritance java supports the concept of code reusability.

Types of inheritance:-
1. Single Level Inheritance
2. Multilevel Inheritance
3. Multiple Inheritance
4. Hierarchial
5. Hybrid

Single Level Inheritance
 A  Parent/Super/Base
 |
 v
 B  Child/Sub/Derived

In Single Level Inheritance one class is derived from another class. The class from which one class is derived is called Parent/Super/Base class and the class 
which is derived is called Child/Sub/Derived class

Multilevel Inheritance

 A  Parent of A/ Grandparent of C
 |
 v
 B  Child of A/ Parent of C
 |
 v
 B  Child of C/ Grandchild of A
 Here one class is derieved from another class, and from that derived class another class is derived

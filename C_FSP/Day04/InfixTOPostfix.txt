Infix to Postfix

1. Print operands as they arrive
2. If stack is empty or left parenthesis is present on the top of the stack, push the incoming operator onto the stack
3. If incoming symbol is left parenthesis then push it onto the stack
4. If incoming symbol is right parenthesis then pop the stack and print them until left parenthesis encountered
5.i) If incoming symbol has higher precedence than the top of stack then push it to stack
  ii) If incoming symbol has lower precedence than the top of the stack then pop and print the top of iii) the stack and again check the next symbol in the stack
  iv) If incoming symbol has equal precedence with the top of the stack then use associative rule
        a. If associativity is fron left to right then pop and print the top of the stack and psuh the incoming operator
        b. If associativity is from right to left then push the incoming operator
6. At the end of the expression, pop and print all the operators from the stack
